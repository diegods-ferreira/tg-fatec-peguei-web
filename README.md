  Since the TG (acronym for <i>"Graduation Work"</i>, in Portuguese) can be developed by groups with up to 3 members, we decided to come together to develop the application proposed in our work. Thus, our group consists of:
</p>
<br>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <th>Member name</th>
    <th>Main responsibility</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/danilo-dsf">Danilo Ferreira</a></td>
      <td>Architect, structure and develop the application back-end</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/diegods-ferreira">Diego Ferreira</a></td>
      <td>Design, architect and develop the mobile front end of the application</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/rcoelh0">Rafael Coelho</a></td>
      <td>Architect, structure and develop the application back-end</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="main-libraries-used">Main libraries used</h2>
<p>
  As the entire ecosystem around this stack is quite vast, full of libraries ready to implement in our application and make use according to our objective, below are listed the main libraries we use:

<br>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <th>Library Name</th>

    <th>What it was use for?</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>typescript</td>
      <td>3.8.3</td>
      <td>It was used so that we could work with data typing and thus avoid problems as the project grows</td>
    </tr>
