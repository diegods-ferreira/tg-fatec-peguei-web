## **Group members**
Since the TG (acronym for *"Graduation Work"*, in Portuguese) can be developed by groups with up to 3 members, we decided to come together to develop the application proposed in our work. Thus, our group consists of: 


|**Member name**|**Main responsibility**|
| :-: | :-: |
|[Danilo Ferreira](https://github.com/danilo-dsf)|Architect, structure and develop the application back-end|
|[Diego Ferreira](https://github.com/diegods-ferreira)|Design, architect and develop the mobile front end of the application|
|[Rafael Coelho](https://github.com/rcoelh0)|Architect, structure and develop the application back-end|


## **Main libraries used**
As the entire ecosystem around this stack is quite vast, full of libraries ready to implement in our application and make use according to our objective, below are listed the main libraries we use: 


|**Library Name**|**Version**|**What it was use for?**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|typescript|3.8.3|It was used so that we could work with data typing and thus avoid problems as the project grows|
|eslint|6.8.0|Used to enforce code style and design pattern|
|prettier|2.1.2|Used to enforce code style and design pattern|
|axios|0.20.0|It was used to enable the app to make requests to the external API|
|styled-components|5.2.0|It was used to do all the styling of the application components|
|yup|0.29.3|It was used to perform validations on forms|
